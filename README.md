## About this fork

This repository is an independent, maintained fork of
[`maziggy/bambuddy`](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy). It is not an official
upstream release or a replacement for the upstream project.

The fork has three goals:

- Add first-class **FlashForge LAN** and **Klipper/Moonraker** printer support.
- Keep Bambu Lab behavior compatible with upstream while moving shared features
  toward provider-neutral interfaces.
- Regularly merge changes from upstream `main` so fixes and new Bambuddy
  features continue to flow into this fork.

Fork builds are published from this repository as
[`ghcr.io/noobydp/bambuddy:latest`](https://github.com/noobydp/bambuddy/pkgs/container/bambuddy).
Use this repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/noobydp/bambuddy/issues)
for FlashForge, Klipper, or fork-specific problems. See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for
the provider scope, support expectations, and upstream-sync policy.

This fork would not exist without the upstream project and its contributors.
Please support upstream as well:

- **Explore and star
  [`maziggy/bambuddy`](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy)**, and use its
  [documentation](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool) and
  [discussions](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/discussions) for shared
  Bambuddy features.
- **Contribute generally useful fixes upstream.** If a problem or improvement
  also applies to an unmodified Bambuddy installation, consider reporting or
  contributing it to upstream. FlashForge, Klipper, and fork-specific provider
  work should be reported here.
- **Support the upstream maintainer** through
  [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maziggy) or
  [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/maziggy).

## 🌐 FlashForge Creator 5 Pro and Klipper/Moonraker support
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" alt="Updated dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe8efd8-b9c2-4944-8bbf-a4ae75c48796" />
</p>

- **FlashForge LAN:** confirmed against the Creator 5 Pro, including monitoring,
  camera, storage, upload/start, print controls, temperatures, lights, speed,
  thumbnails, and notifications. See
  [the FlashForge capability notes](docs/flashforge-local-api.md).
- **Klipper/Moonraker:** capability-discovered monitoring and controls, cameras,
  files, macros, console, heaters, fans, motion/leveling controls, sensors, and
  toolchanger state. Initial live validation uses modern TinyT and Trident
  installations.
- **Provider-neutral direction:** new shared features should depend on reported
  capabilities rather than Bambu model checks, making future printer providers
  easier to add.

## 🌐 NEW: Remote Printing with Proxy Mode

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/proxy-mode-diagram.png" alt="Proxy Mode Architecture" width="800">
</p>

**Print from anywhere in the world** — Bambuddy's new Proxy Mode acts as a secure relay between your slicer and printer:

- 🔒 **End-to-end TLS encryption** — FTP, file transfer, and camera are transparently proxied with the printer's real TLS certificate
- 🛡️ **Optional Tailscale integration** — per-VP toggle + Docker socket mount surface the host's Tailscale IP on the VP card, so you know which `100.x.x.x` to paste into the slicer when you want a virtual printer reachable over your tailnet ([setup](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/virtual-printer/)). Bambuddy's self-signed CA import is still required on the slicer side: Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer validate printer TLS against a bundled BBL CA (not the system trust store), **and** their Add Printer dialog is IP-only (no hostname to match an LE cert against), so a publicly-trusted cert can't help on either dimension. Tailscale's role is the private tunnel (reachability from anywhere, no port forwarding), not cert-import elimination.
- 🌍 **No cloud dependency** — Direct connection through your own Bambuddy server
- 🔑 **Uses printer's access code** — No additional credentials needed
- ⚡ **Full-speed printing** — Transparent TCP proxy, only MQTT is decrypted for IP rewriting

Perfect for remote print farms, traveling makers, or accessing your home printer from work.

## 🍰 NEW: Integrated Slicing — Slice & Print, All In One Place

**No desktop slicer required.** Drop an STL or 3MF into Bambuddy's File Manager, hit **Slice**, and the result lands as a ready-to-print `.gcode.3mf` in the same folder — without ever opening Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer.

- 🍰 **One-click slicing** — Slice from any browser. The job runs server-side in a [tiny sidecar container](slicer-api/README.md), progress streams back as a toast, and the sliced file appears in your library when it's done.
- 📱 **Slice from your phone or tablet** — Bambuddy's PWA + the new server-side slicer means you can drop an STL in from mobile and queue a print without ever touching a desktop.
- 🎒 **Bring your own profiles** — Import a `Printer Preset Bundle` (`.bbscfg`) exported from Bambu Studio: pick a curated **printer + process + filament** triplet from a dropdown in the Slice dialog, no more juggling JSON files.
- 🔄 **Re-slice for a different printer in one click** — Open any sliced archive in Bambuddy and re-slice it for any printer, including across the single-nozzle ↔ dual-nozzle (H2D / H2D Pro) boundary that BambuStudio's CLI would normally reject. Bambuddy detects the class change and auto-arranges objects laid out for the source bed (e.g. X1C 256×256) so they land safely on the target (e.g. H2D 350×320 with its per-nozzle dead zones).
- 🍱 **Slice all plates at once** — Multi-plate projects (parted statues, multi-part kits) get a "Slice all N plates" toggle in the Slice dialog. One click produces a single `.gcode.3mf` containing every plate's gcode, ready for the printer. The toast shows "Plate 2 of 5 — Generating G-code (47%)" as the loop runs.
- 🔁 **Same dispatch as the rest of Bambuddy** — The sliced output flows into the existing queue / plate-picker / AMS-mapping path, so all the regular conveniences (multi-printer dispatch, AMS routing, scheduled prints) just work.

Optional but recommended — drop the [`slicer-api/` Compose stack](slicer-api/README.md) next to your Bambuddy install and the **Slice** button lights up everywhere.

## 🧩 NEW: Slicer Pipelines — Save a Recipe, Reuse in One Click

**Stop re-picking the same printer + process + filament + bed-type combination every slice.** Save a Slicer **Pipeline** once from the Slice dialog, then apply the whole bundle to any file with a single click — from File Manager, Archives, or MakerWorld imports.

- 🧩 **One-click reuse** — A pipeline captures the entire Slice modal selection (printer + process + per-AMS-slot filaments + bed type) and surfaces as **Run with pipeline → \<name\>** on every sliceable row.
- 🎯 **Specific printer or printer class** — Pin a pipeline to one printer, or to a *class* (e.g. *any X1C*) and let the queue scheduler pick the first available match. Identical-fleet farms get a single recipe instead of one-per-printer.
- 🪢 **Multi-copy fanout** — Slice once, dispatch up to N copies. With class targeting the copies fan out across the matching printers in parallel — **Spread** (fastest wall-clock), **Single printer** (minimise colour-change overhead), or **First N** (one to each).
- 📊 **Runs dashboard** — A new **Pipelines** tab on the Print Queue page lists every run with colour-coded status badges (queued / slicing / dispatching / in-progress / completed / partial-failure / failed / cancelled), per-copy detail on expand, filter dropdowns (Pipeline / Status / Target), and a **Retry failed** button that re-runs only the copies that didn't complete — successful copies are never re-printed.
- 🔒 **Permission-gated** — Three permissions (`pipelines:read` / `pipelines:write` / `pipelines:run`) let you split authoring the recipe from spending filament with it.

👉 **[Slicer Pipelines Guide →](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/slicer-pipelines/)**

## Why Bambuddy?

- **Own your data** — All print history stored locally, no cloud dependency
- **Works offline** — Uses Developer Mode for direct printer control via local network
- **Full automation** — Schedule prints, auto power-off, get notified when done
- **Multi-printer support** — Manage your entire print farm from one interface

### FlashForge LAN support

Bambuddy includes experimental FlashForge LAN support for confirmed compatible models such as the Creator 5 Pro. It supports monitoring, camera snapshots/streaming, upload/start, pause/resume/stop, heater targets, chamber light, print speed, file listing, thumbnails, and notifications. Some Bambu-only controls are intentionally hidden when the FlashForge LAN API does not expose an equivalent command. See [docs/flashforge-local-api.md](docs/flashforge-local-api.md) for the current feature matrix and capability contract.

## ✨ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📦 Print Archive
- Automatic 3MF archiving with metadata
- 3D model preview (Three.js)
- Duplicate detection & full-text search
- Photo attachments & failure analysis
- Timelapse editor (trim, speed, music) with automatic AVI-to-MP4 conversion for P1-series printers, manual upload & remove
- Re-print to any connected printer with AMS mapping (auto-match or manual slot selection, multi-plate support, nozzle-aware matching for dual-nozzle H2D/H2D Pro, **Filament Track Switch (FTS) support** — when the FTS accessory is installed the per-nozzle filter is suppressed since the FTS routes any AMS slot to either extruder)
- Plate thumbnail browsing for multi-plate archives (hover to navigate between plates)
- Archive comparison (side-by-side diff)
- Tag management (rename/delete across all archives)
- **Per-archive print history** — Each archive card shows an `N prints` badge whenever a model has been printed more than once (reprint + failed retries all counted). Click the badge for the full per-archive Print Log — every individual run with date, status, duration, filament used, cost, and failure reason. Reprints contribute new rows so a failed retry never overwrites the source archive's data — the original 100 g successful print stays visible alongside the 10 g failed reprint, and Quick Stats add up to 110 g across both events.
- **Print Log** — Chronological table view of all print activity with columns for date/time, print name, printer, user, status, duration, and filament. Filterable by search, printer, user, status, and date range. Pagination with configurable page size. Clear button removes log entries without affecting archives.

### 📊 Monitoring & Control
- Real-time printer status via WebSocket
- Live camera streaming (MJPEG) & snapshots with multi-viewer support — most Bambu printers only allow one upstream connection, so Bambuddy fans out a single shared stream to all browser tabs / cards / overlays
- **Cam Wall view** — Toggle the Printers page from cards into a responsive grid of camera tiles for at-a-glance monitoring across the whole farm. On-screen tiles stream live up to a configurable cap (default 4) so RPi installs stay sustainable; the rest fall back to periodic snapshot polling, and off-screen tiles pause entirely. Per-user settings (live cap, snapshot interval); click any tile to open the floating viewer or the dedicated camera window depending on your existing camera-view preference
- **Long-lived camera tokens** for Home Assistant / Frigate / kiosks — mint a token from Settings → API Keys, paste it once, capped at 365 days, revocable at any time (no infinite tokens — leaked permanent tokens are unsafe by design)
- **Streaming overlay for OBS** - Embeddable page with camera + status for live streaming (`/overlay/:printerId`), configurable FPS (`?fps=30`), status-only mode (`?camera=false`)
- External camera support (MJPEG, RTSP, HTTP snapshot, USB/V4L2) with layer-based timelapse
- **Build plate empty detection** - Auto-pause print if objects detected on plate (multi-reference calibration, ROI adjustment)
- Fan monitoring and **speed control** for part-cooling, auxiliary, and chamber fans (0–100% with customizable quick-select presets)
- Printer control (stop, pause, resume, chamber light, print speed, **airduct mode** for P2S/H2*, **temperature setpoints** for nozzle / bed / **chamber heater** on H2C/H2D/H2DPro/H2S/X2D, **Z-jog / XY-jog / extruder jog**, customizable temperature & fan presets under Settings → Workflow)
- **Status badges on printer card**: SD Card (green / red), Enclosure Door (green / yellow — X1/P1S/P2S/H2*), Airduct Mode (cooling / heating)
- **Force Refresh** menu item — request a full status push from the printer without reconnecting
- **Maintenance Mode** — put a printer "out of service" without removing it. Toggle from the card's three-dot menu, the in-card amber banner, or the Edit Printer dialog; the printer disconnects MQTT, drops out of queue dispatch, the scheduler, model-based filament lookups, metrics, and notifications until you take it out again. The card stays visible (amber wrench banner + Exit button) so the printer never disappears from your dashboard. Useful for parallel Bambuddy installs sharing the same hardware, printers under repair or awaiting parts, and temporary suspension.
- Bulk printer actions (multi-select cards, then stop/pause/resume/clear all — select by state or location)
- Printer search and filters — live search by name/model/location/serial plus status and location dropdown filters (WebSocket-reactive, mobile-friendly)
- Resizable printer cards (S/M/L/XL)
- Skip objects during print
- AMS slot RFID re-read
- **AMS slot Load / Unload from the printer card** — Hover any AMS slot or external spool, click the menu button, and load that tray or unload the currently-loaded one without going to the touchscreen; supports dual-extruder H2D (Ext-L / Ext-R drive their own nozzle)
- **AMS Filament Backup status + control with pair view** — Mirrors BambuStudio's per-printer "AMS Filament Backup" auto-switch (when a spool runs out, the printer rolls over to a same-preset, same-colour spool in another slot). A small badge in the Filaments section header on each printer card shows the live state (blue circular-arrow icon = ON, dim = OFF, "?" = A1 family with no `cfg` field yet); click to open the AMS Filament Backup modal — a BambuStudio Auto Refill-style ring graphic per backup pair, with the filament colour as the ring fill and member slot labels (e.g. `A·1`, `B·3`) on contrast-aware pills around the band. Dual-extruder printers (H2D / H2C / X2D) carry an `R` / `L` badge per ring because the firmware can't cross extruders. State syncs in real time whether you toggled from Bambuddy, BambuStudio, or the printer's touchscreen. Bambuddy's "insufficient filament" check is **backup-aware**: when Backup is ON, the deficit check pools remaining grams across same-`(preset, colour)` spools on the printer, so the warning doesn't fire spuriously when the firmware will swap to a peer mid-print (#1762). Bambuddy's **Prefer Lowest Remaining Filament** sort also respects the toggle — when Backup is OFF the dispatcher skips the prefer-lowest sort entirely so it won't reach for a near-empty spool the printer can't roll off of.
- AMS slot configuration (model-filtered presets, K profiles, color picker, pre-population for configured slots)
- AMS info card (hover for serial number, firmware version) with custom friendly names that persist across printers
- **AMS remote drying** — Start, monitor, and stop drying sessions for AMS 2 Pro and AMS-HT directly from the Printers page with filament-based temperature/duration presets, optional spool rotation; automatic PSU detection and HMS power error reporting. Rotate-spool toggle is disabled per-AMS when any tray has filament threaded into the feed tube (the AMS mechanism is locked there — rotating would jam the filament)
- **Queue auto-drying** — Automatically dry filament between scheduled prints when humidity exceeds threshold; configurable presets per filament type, optional blocking mode
- **Ambient drying** — Automatically keep filament dry on idle printers based on humidity, regardless of whether prints are queued
- **Continue drying while printing** — On capable hardware (H2D 01.03.00.00+, H2C / H2S / P2S / H2D Pro 01.02.00.00+, X2D / A2L 01.01.00.00+, X1C 01.11.02.00+), auto-drying can keep running during a print. Default off, opt-in toggle in Settings → Print Queue. Drying temperature is automatically capped 5°C below the idle preset (floor 40°C) to protect spools inside the hot enclosure
- Configurable drying presets per filament type (temperature & duration for AMS 2 Pro and AMS-HT)
- **Per-filament humidity threshold** — Set a different humidity trigger per filament type (e.g. Nylon at 20%, PLA at 60%, ASA at 30%) instead of one global value. Mixed-material AMS units use the most-restrictive threshold across the loaded spools so a single PLA + Nylon unit triggers at Nylon's level. Drives both the auto-drying scheduler and the hourly humidity alarm so the two can never disagree on whether a unit is "too humid"
- Dual external spool support for H2D (Ext-L / Ext-R)
- **HMS error monitoring with one-click actions** — Live HMS error log with history and the same Resume / Stop / Continue / Retry / Check Assistant / Don't Remind Me action buttons BambuStudio shows. Click and the matching MQTT command goes back to the printer — no more walking to the device just to dismiss a paused-print dialog. Catalog covers every Bambu model (X1 / P1 / A1 / H2 series); buttons are translated in all 11 supported locales
- **Heater history charts** — Bambuddy logs nozzle, bed, and chamber readings every minute and surfaces them via a tiny chart icon on each heater tile in the printer card. Click for a per-heater modal with current / average / min / max stats, target overlay, and a 6h / 24h / 48h / 7d time range — works on read-only chamber sensors (X1C / P2S) too. AMS humidity and temperature get the same treatment (already shipped).
- Print success rates & trends
- Filament usage tracking
- Cost analytics & failure analysis
- **AI print-failure detection** — Optional integration with a self-hosted [Obico](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/obico-server) ML API: watches each running print's camera feed, smooths scores over time (30-frame warmup + EWM + rolling means), and fires a configurable action once per print (notify / pause / pause-and-off)
- Per-user statistics filtering (admin permission gated)
- CSV/Excel export

### ⏰ Scheduling & Automation
- **Unified dispatch through the queue** — Every print Bambuddy starts (File Manager, archive reprint, printer-card upload-and-print, scheduled queue items) flows through the same queue scheduler, so each print is visible on the queue page, attributable to the user that started it, deficit-checked, and cancellable from one place. FTP uploads and print-start commands run in the background with real-time WebSocket progress toasts (per-job upload bars, status badges, cancel button). Installations with custom groups or API keys: the immediate-print actions now require the `queue:create` permission alongside the existing `printers:control` — see [the permissions guide](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/admin/permissions/) if you've granted control without queue-create
- Print queue with three tabs (Queue / History / Timeline), multi-select drag-and-drop, batch grouping, and a Gantt-style timeline
- Multi-printer selection (send to multiple printers at once)
- Batch grouping — multi-plate prints auto-group into a collapsible row; any 2+ selected items can be grouped manually via "Group as batch", with ungroup on the batch parent
- Batch print quantity (print multiple copies — set quantity in the print/schedule dialog, first copy prints immediately, rest are queued)
- Staggered batch start (start printers in groups with configurable interval to avoid power spikes — works in both Print and Queue dialogs)
- Configurable default print options (bed levelling, flow/vibration calibration, first layer inspection, timelapse) in Settings → Workflow
- Model-based queue assignment (send to "any X1C" for load balancing) with location filtering
- Filament override for model-based queue (swap filament colors/types before scheduling)
- Filament validation (only assign to printers with required filaments)
- Prefer lowest remaining filament (consume partial spools first when multiple match)
- Per-printer AMS mapping (individual slot configuration for print farms)
- Scheduled prints (date/time)
- Shortest Job First scheduling (SJF toggle on queue page — scheduler picks shorter prints first, with starvation guard)
- Queue Only mode (stage without auto-start)
- Clear plate confirmation between queued prints (can be disabled in settings for farm workflows)
- Auto-print G-code injection (per-model start/end snippets for Farmloop, SwapMod, AutoClear, Printflow 3D — toggle per queue item)
- **Preheat & Heat Soak before queued prints** — Heat the bed (and the chamber, on supported printers) and hold at temperature between FTP upload and print start. Per-print Inherit / On / Off override in the Print Options panel; per-filament chamber-target map under Settings → Workflow so PA wants 50°C, ABS 45°C, PETG-CF 40°C, PLA 0°C (skips chamber phase automatically). Hardware-aware: H-series / X2D / X1E actively heat the chamber via M141; X1C / P2S rely on bed radiation with a chamber-sensor wait; P1S / P1P / A1 family have no chamber sensor so only the soak timer applies. The cooling/heating airduct flap on H-series / X2D / P2S auto-switches to match the resolved chamber target — preheat for ABS opens nothing and recirculates warm air; preheat for PLA opens the exhaust and vents — so engineering filaments actually reach target instead of fighting the open flap, and PLA prints don't inherit a previously-hot recirculation. M191 (wait-for-chamber-temp) isn't honoured by Bambu firmware, so doing this at the orchestration layer is the only place it works
- Smart plug integration (Tasmota, Home Assistant, MQTT, REST/Webhook)
- REST smart plugs: Control any device with an HTTP API (openHAB, ioBroker, FHEM, Node-RED) with separate power/energy URLs and unit multipliers
- MQTT smart plugs: Subscribe to Zigbee2MQTT, Shelly, or any MQTT topic for energy monitoring
- Energy consumption tracking (per-print kWh and cost) — restart-resilient: mid-print backend restarts no longer lose per-print energy
- Energy statistics by date range (Today / Week / Month / …) in total-consumption mode via hourly lifetime-counter snapshots
- HA energy sensor support (for plugs with separate power/energy sensors)
- Auto power-on before print
- Auto power-off after cooldown

### 📁 File Manager (Library)
- Upload and organize sliced files (3MF, gcode, STL)
- **External folder mounting** - Mount host directories (NAS, USB, network shares) without copying files. Operator-controlled via the `BAMBUDDY_EXTERNAL_ROOTS` env var (colon-separated allowlist of host paths users are permitted to register; empty by default to disable the feature). See [Docker → External library folders](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/getting-started/docker/#external-library-folders-bambuddy_external_roots).
- **STL thumbnail generation** - Auto-generate previews for STL files on upload or batch generate for existing files
- ZIP file extraction with folder structure preservation
- Option to create folder from ZIP filename
- Folder structure with drag-and-drop
- Rename files and folders via context menu
- Print directly to any printer with full options
- Add to queue without creating archive upfront
- Plate selection for multi-plate 3MF files
- Duplicate detection via file hash
- Mobile-friendly with always-visible action buttons
- **Server-side Slice button** (optional) — slice STL/3MF without a desktop slicer when the [`slicer-api/` Compose stack](slicer-api/README.md) is running; the result lands as a new `.gcode.3mf` in the same folder, with progress shown via a toast tracker that follows the job to completion. Supports importing **Bambu Studio Printer Preset Bundles** (`.bbscfg`) so a curated printer + process + filament triplet can be picked in the Slice dialog without re-uploading JSON profiles ([details](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/slicer-api/#slicer-bundles-bbscfg))

### 🌍 MakerWorld & Printables Integration
- Paste any `makerworld.com/models/…` or `printables.com/model/…` URL → preview and import without leaving Bambuddy
- Per-plate **Save** or **Save & Slice in Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer** (your preferred slicer from Settings)
- **Import all plates** button for multi-plate models
- Auto-creates a "MakerWorld" folder in File Manager; override with any existing folder via the picker
- Printables models expose each supported STL/3MF/STEP file individually, including its format and size, and import into a dedicated "Printables" folder
- Public Printables downloads work anonymously; MakerWorld downloads continue to reuse your existing Bambu Cloud login
- Per-plate image gallery with keyboard-navigable lightbox
- Recent imports sidebar — last 10 imports from either provider with one-click jump to File Manager, slicer, or the source model
- Remove-from-library for imported plates with confirm modal (no LAN cookie paste, no browser extension)

### 📁 Projects
- Group related prints (e.g., "Voron Build")
- Track plates (print jobs) and parts separately
- Auto-detect parts count from 3MF files
- Color-coded project badges
- **Project URL + cover photo** — paste a MakerWorld/Printables/Thingiverse link and upload a hero image so each card is immediately recognisable; the URL renders as a one-click link beside the project name
- Bulk assign archives via multi-select toolbar
- Import/Export projects as ZIP (includes files) or JSON
- Print or queue files from linked library folders directly in the project view (resulting archive auto-linked to the project)

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔔 Notifications
- WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord
- Email, Pushover, ntfy (with per-event priority — Min / Low / Default / High / Urgent)
- Home Assistant persistent notifications
- Custom webhooks
- Quiet hours & daily digest
- Customizable message templates with per-filament usage details
- Print finish photo URL in notifications
- Filament usage and progress in failed/cancelled print notifications
- **Missing spool assignment warning** — Toast and push notification when a print starts with unassigned AMS trays
- HMS error alerts (AMS, nozzle, etc.)
- Build plate detection alerts
- First layer complete alert (with camera snapshot)
- Bed cooled alerts (configurable threshold)
- Queue events (waiting, skipped, failed)

### 🧵 Spool Inventory
- Built-in spool inventory with AMS slot assignment, usage tracking, and remaining weight management
- Automatic filament consumption tracking: 3MF slicer estimates for all spools (primary), AMS remain% delta as fallback
- Mid-print spool reassignment support: uses live assignment if changed during print, snapshot otherwise
- Per-layer gcode accuracy for partial prints (failed/cancelled), with linear scaling fallback
- **Per-spool cost tracking** — Set cost/kg on each spool; costs are automatically calculated at print completion and aggregated to archives. Print modal shows real-time cost preview. Configurable default cost and currency in Settings.
- **Bulk spool addition** — Add multiple identical spools at once (quantity 1–100) with a single form submission. Quick Add mode for stock spools that only need material, color, and weight.
- Spool catalog, color catalog, PA profile matching, and low-stock alerts
- **Multi-colour gradients, transparency, and visual effects** — Paste a comma-separated hex list (e.g. from 3dfilamentprofiles.com) to render a spool as a gradient or conic colour wheel; transparency shows through a checkerboard so the alpha you set is the alpha you see; pick a visual effect (sparkle, wood, marble, glow, matte) for the swatch overlay. Same fields are editable on the colour catalog so combos can be reused across spools.
- **Printable spool labels** — Generate PDF labels for any selection of spools in four pre-built sizes: AMS holder (30×15 mm), box label (62×29 mm), Avery L7160 sheet (A4, 21 per page), and Avery 5160 sheet (US Letter, 30 per page). Each label shows the colour swatch, brand, material, name, the **spool ID** (for at-a-glance identification across many similar spools), and a QR code that deep-links straight back to the spool's row in Bambuddy when scanned with a phone.

- [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) filament sync with per-filament usage tracking and fill level display
- MQTT publishing for Home Assistant, Node-RED, etc.
- **Prometheus metrics** - Export printer telemetry for Grafana dashboards
- Bambu Cloud profile management
- **Orca Cloud profile sync** — read your OrcaSlicer 2.4.0+ cloud-synced profiles directly in Bambuddy, usable for slicing alongside Bambu Cloud / local / standard presets. Four sign-in providers (Google / Apple / GitHub / email+password)
- **Local Profiles** - Import OrcaSlicer presets (`.orca_filament`, `.bbscfg`, `.bbsflmt`, `.zip`, `.json`) without Bambu Cloud
- K-profiles (pressure advance)
- **GitHub backup** - Schedule automatic backups of cloud profiles, k profiles and settings to GitHub
- **Scheduled local backups** - Automatic backup snapshots on hourly/daily/weekly schedule with retention management and NAS-mountable output
- External sidebar links
- Webhooks & API keys
  - Per-user ownership — each key acts on behalf of its creator
  - Optional **cloud-access scope** — opt in to let an API key read its owner's Bambu Cloud + Orca Cloud presets / filament catalogue / device list (off by default)
- Interactive API browser with live testing

### 🖨️ Virtual Printer & Remote Printing
- **🌐 Proxy Mode** — Print remotely from anywhere via secure TLS relay
- **🪞 Live target-printer mirror in non-proxy modes (NEW!)** — Immediate / Review / Queue VPs now mirror their target printer's live state to the slicer: AMS slot contents, FTS / dual-extruder routing, k-profiles, AMS load / dry / calibration commands, and the camera stream all flow through the VP. Use the slicer as a full remote for the printer behind the VP without giving up Bambuddy's queue / archive / dispatch features.
- Emulates a Bambu Lab printer on your network
- Send prints directly from Bambu Studio/Orca Slicer
- Configurable printer model (X1C, P1S, A1, H2D, etc.)
- Archive mode, Review mode, Queue mode, or Proxy mode
- Queue mode: optional **force-color-match** so the scheduler refuses to dispatch onto a printer with the wrong filament loaded
- SSDP discovery (same LAN) or manual IP entry (VPN/remote)
- Network interface override for multi-NIC/Docker/VPN setups
- Secure TLS/MQTT/FTP communication

### 🛠️ Maintenance & Support
- Maintenance scheduling & tracking
- Interval reminders (hours/days)
- Print time accuracy stats
- File manager for printer storage
- Firmware update helper with version badge (LAN-only printers) — lists all announced versions with Usable/Unavailable/Installed badges and supports rollback to older firmware
- Debug logging toggle with live indicator
- Live application log viewer with filtering
- Support bundle generator with comprehensive diagnostics (privacy-filtered)
- **In-app bug reporting** — Submit bug reports directly from the UI with optional screenshot (upload, paste, or drag & drop), interactive debug log capture (start logging, reproduce at your own pace, stop & submit), and system info. Reports create GitHub issues via a secure relay. Privacy-first: all logs are sanitized and sensitive data (IPs, serials, credentials) is never included.

### 🔒 Optional Authentication
- Enable/disable authentication any time
- Group-based permissions (80+ granular permissions)
- Default groups: Administrators, Operators, Viewers
- JWT tokens with secure password hashing
- Comprehensive API protection (200+ endpoints secured)
- User management (create, edit, delete, groups)
- User activity tracking (who uploaded archives, library files, queued prints, started prints)
- **Per-user Bambu Cloud accounts** — Each user has their own independent Cloud login for profiles
- **Advanced Auth via Email** — SMTP integration for automated user onboarding and self-service password resets
- Admin creates users with email — system sends secure random password automatically
- Users can reset their own password from the login screen (no admin needed)
- Customizable email templates (welcome email, password reset)
- **Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP + Email OTP)** — Per-user opt-in 2FA compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 2FAS and any standard TOTP app, or a 6-digit code delivered by email. Each user gets 10 single-use backup codes. Brute-force-protected (per-user + per-IP rate limits), replay-protected (same code cannot be accepted twice in the same 30 s window), and the pre-auth token is a single-use DB-backed challenge bound to the browser session via an HttpOnly cookie.
- **Single Sign-On (OIDC / SSO)** — Log in via PocketID, Authentik, Keycloak, or any standards-compliant OIDC provider. PKCE (S256) for public clients, `email_verified` gating, issuer & `aud`/`nonce` validation, opt-in account linking via verified email, optional auto-provisioning of new BamBuddy accounts, and strict SSRF hardening on every URL pulled from the OIDC discovery document (scheme + private/loopback/link-local IP checks).
- **Per-user email notifications** — Users receive email alerts for their own print jobs (start, complete, failed, stopped) with individual toggle controls

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Docker on a Linux AMD64 host is recommended for the published fork image.
- The Bambuddy host must be able to reach the printer on the local network.
- **Bambu Lab:** Developer Mode, access code, serial number, and LAN connectivity.
- **FlashForge:** supported LAN mode and the printer's LAN credentials.
- **Klipper:** reachable Moonraker endpoint (normally port `7125`) and an API key
  only when the Moonraker configuration requires one.
- Python 3.10+ and Node.js are needed only when running directly from source.

### Installation

#### Windows (Native Installer)

This fork does not currently publish a signed Windows installer release.
Docker Desktop or a source installation from this repository will include the
FlashForge and Klipper changes. The installer downloadable from upstream
installs upstream Bambuddy and does **not** provide this fork's additions.

#### Docker (Linux / macOS / Windows via Docker Desktop)

**Option A: Pre-built fork image (recommended)**
```bash
mkdir bambuddy && cd bambuddy
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noobydp/bambuddy/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

**Option B: Build from source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/noobydp/bambuddy.git
cd bambuddy
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

> **Published architecture:** The fork's pre-built image currently targets
> `linux/amd64`, including typical Unraid servers. Other architectures can
> build the repository from source.

> **macOS/Windows users:** Docker Desktop doesn't support `network_mode: host`. Edit docker-compose.yml: comment out `network_mode: host` and uncomment the `ports:` section. Printer discovery won't work - add printers manually by IP.

> **Linux users:** If you get "permission denied" errors, either prefix commands with `sudo` (e.g., `sudo docker compose up -d`) or [add your user to the docker group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker Configuration & Commands</strong></summary>

**Environment Variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Your timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/Berlin`) |
| `PORT` | `8000` | Port BamBuddy runs on (with host networking mode) |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |

**Data Persistence:**

| Volume | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `bambuddy.db` | SQLite database with all your print data (not used with PostgreSQL) |
| `archive/` | Archived 3MF files and thumbnails |
| `logs/` | Application logs |

**Updating:**

```bash
# Pre-built image: just pull the latest
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

# From source: rebuild after pulling changes
cd bambuddy && git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

**Fork image tags:**

```bash
# Recommended combined build
docker pull ghcr.io/noobydp/bambuddy:latest

# Compatibility aliases currently point to the same combined build
docker pull ghcr.io/noobydp/bambuddy:flashforge-creator5pro
docker pull ghcr.io/noobydp/bambuddy:klipper-moonraker
```

The image is rebuilt from `main` after each accepted change. `latest` is the
canonical tag for installations that should receive all fork features.

**Useful Commands:**

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop/Start
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# Shell access
docker compose exec bambuddy /bin/bash
```

**Custom Port:**

```yaml
ports:
  - "3000:8000"  # Access on port 3000
```

**Reverse Proxy (Nginx):**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name bambuddy.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }
}
```

> **Note:** WebSocket support is required for real-time printer updates.

**Network Mode Host** (required for printer discovery and camera streaming):

```yaml
services:
  bambuddy:
    build: .
    network_mode: host
```

> **Note:** Docker's default bridge networking cannot receive SSDP multicast packets for automatic printer discovery. When using `network_mode: host`, Bambuddy auto-detects your network subnet and can discover printers via subnet scanning in the Add Printer dialog.

</details>

#### Manual Installation (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/noobydp/bambuddy.git
cd bambuddy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run (--loop asyncio avoids a uvloop TLS bug that can truncate VP FTP uploads)
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --loop asyncio
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** and add your printer!

> **Need detailed instructions?** See the [Installation Guide](http://wiki.bambuddy.cool/getting-started/installation/)

### Windows Docker Desktop helper

Run from PowerShell with Docker Desktop already installed:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noobydp/bambuddy/main/install/docker-install.ps1 -OutFile docker-install.ps1; .\docker-install.ps1"
```

The helper downloads this fork's Compose configuration, switches it from host
networking to Windows-compatible port mappings, and starts Bambuddy. Printer
discovery is unavailable through Docker Desktop, so add printers manually by
IP address.

### Enabling Developer Mode

Developer Mode allows third-party software like Bambuddy to control your printer over the local network.

1. On printer: **Settings** → **Network** → **LAN Only Mode** → Enable
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (appears after LAN Only Mode is enabled)
3. Note the **Access Code** displayed
4. Find IP address in network settings
5. Find Serial Number in device info

> **Note:** Developer Mode disables cloud features but provides full local control. Standard LAN Mode (without Developer Mode) only allows read-only monitoring.

### Slicer Settings

In Bambu Studio or OrcaSlicer, enable **"Store sent files on external storage"** so that print files (3MF) are saved to the printer's SD card. Bambuddy needs these files to extract thumbnails and 3D model previews.

1. Open **Bambu Studio** or **OrcaSlicer**
2. Go to the **Device** tab for your printer
3. In **Print Options**, enable **Store Sent Files on External Storage**

## 🖨️ Supported Printers

| Provider | Confirmed or inherited coverage | Connection | Status |
|----------|---------------------------------|------------|--------|
| Bambu Lab | X1/X2, H2, P1/P2, A1/A2 families inherited from upstream | Developer Mode over LAN | Upstream-compatible |
| FlashForge | Creator 5 Pro confirmed; other compatible LAN models require testing | FlashForge LAN API | Experimental |
| Klipper / Moonraker | Modern TinyT and Trident installations confirmed; other Moonraker printers are capability-discovered | Moonraker HTTP/WebSocket, normally port 7125 | Experimental |

Experimental means the provider is usable and tested on the listed hardware,
but it has less model coverage than the inherited Bambu integration. Please
include the exact printer, firmware/Klipper version, and diagnostics when
reporting additional model results.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Database | SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL |
| 3D Viewer | Three.js |
| Communication | MQTT (TLS), FTPS |
