"""Unit tests for the spawn_background_task helper (#1648 follow-up).

asyncio holds only weak references to tasks, so a fire-and-forget
create_task whose return value is discarded can be GC'd mid-flight and
log ``Task was destroyed but it is pending!`` with no traceback.
``spawn_background_task`` is the central helper that fixes this: it
stores a strong reference until completion, surfaces uncaught exceptions
through the logger, and auto-removes finished tasks.
