"""Provider-neutral MJPEG fan-out broadcaster for camera streams.

Printer cameras commonly allow only one efficient upstream connection. This
includes Bambu RTSP/chamber-image cameras, FlashForge MJPEG cameras, and
Moonraker webcam proxies. Without fan-out, opening a second viewer either
duplicates expensive snapshot polling, fails, or kicks the first viewer off.

This module owns a single upstream connection per printer and pushes each
frame to N independent subscriber queues. New viewers tap the existing
upstream; no new printer connection is opened. When the last subscriber
leaves, the upstream is torn down after a short grace window so that a
quick page refresh or second-tab open does not pay a reconnect.
