"""Background-task helper that keeps a strong reference to fire-and-forget tasks.

asyncio holds only a weak reference to tasks returned by ``create_task`` --
when the caller discards the return value (the "fire and forget" pattern),
the task can be garbage-collected mid-execution and the event loop logs
``Task was destroyed but it is pending!`` with no traceback. A support
bundle review under #1648 surfaced 94 such warnings in 8 days of v0.2.4.5.

``spawn_background_task`` is the one place in the codebase that calls
``asyncio.create_task``. It stores the task in a module-level set, removes
it when the task completes, and surfaces any uncaught exception through
the logger so a silently-swallowed error becomes a visible WARNING with
the originating traceback instead of an opaque GC warning.

Use this for any work that should run in the background without being
awaited inline. For tasks that the service owns and needs to cancel on
shutdown, store the returned ``asyncio.Task`` on the service instance
instead (the helper still adds the strong reference, so storing it twice
is redundant but harmless).

# Strong-reference holder. Tasks live here from creation through completion.

# removes each task as it finishes so the set doesn't grow without bound

# the discard breaks the cycle immediately).
